# Gesture_Sensor_Car

This project presents a gesture-controlled robotic car using ESP32 microcontrollers and MPU6050 sensors, enabling wireless control via hand movements without Wi-Fi using the ESP-NOW protocol. The robot uses Motor Wheels (Mecanum wheels) for omnidirectional movement. It offers a compact, low-cost, and intuitive interface, suitable for assistive tech, automation, and educational use. The system combines embedded hardware, wireless communication, and sensor integration for real-time, smooth robot control.
